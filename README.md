# Getting Started with Create React App

## steps to run the app
##### 1: git clone cors proxy server repository from "https://github.com/Stevvvvvi/expressjsproxy" and "npm install" and run "node app.js" to start cors bypass proxy (we need to run a proxy server to bypass cors check from openweathermap.org)
##### 2: git clone this project 
##### 3: inside root folder where package.json located, copy ".env" file into here (I have send the env file to Brock through email)
##### 4: run "npm install"
##### 5: run "npm start" to start the project in "localhost:3000" (proxy cors server runs on localhost:4000)
##### 6: run "npm test -- --coverage" to view the test coverage report.
